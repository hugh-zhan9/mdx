//! The memory layer.
//!
//! Two implementations live here at once during the migration to the mempal
//! engine: `legacy` is the Markdown-and-index memory this application shipped
//! with, re-exported wholesale so every existing caller keeps compiling, and
//! the modules beside it are the replacement being built up slice by slice.
//!
//! Only one of them is ever wired to the command surface. `legacy` is deleted
//! once the new engine owns that surface; see
//! `docs/loopx/plans/2026-08-17-memory-engine-adoption.md`.
