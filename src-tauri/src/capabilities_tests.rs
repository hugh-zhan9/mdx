//! The capability file has to cover every window this app opens.
//!
//! Tauri's ACL is scoped per window label, and a window no pattern matches gets
//! no permissions at all — silently. That is not a visible failure: the window
//! still opens, and every command the app defined itself still works, so the
//! document window read and wrote its file exactly as it should. What it could
//! not do was call a *core* command, and `listen` is one. Its menu subscription
//! was rejected, the rejection went to a `console.warn` nobody reads, and ⌘S in
//! a document window did nothing — while the same key in the workspace window,
//! whose label matched `w*`, saved.
//!
//! So this reads the labels out of the code that builds them and asks the
//! capability file about each one.
