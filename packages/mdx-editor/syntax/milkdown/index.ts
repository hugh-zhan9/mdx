/**
 * The MDX syntax layer, composed in a fixed order.
 *
 * Two orderings here are load-bearing, and each is pinned by a test that fails
 * when it is swapped:
 *
 * Footnote must reach the tree before any other transformer, including the
 * presets' own, so its position in this list is not what decides it: its plugin
 * prepends to `remarkPluginsCtx` rather than appending. Every splitter — the
 * commonmark preset's soft line breaks, wikilink's brackets — leaves fragments
 * with no source `position`, and footnote decides whether a `[^x]` is genuine by
 * checking a text node's value against its own source, which no fragment can
 * satisfy.
 *
 * Source preservation runs last. It is the layer of last resort: it claims what
 * no structured family recognised, so every family that can represent a
 * construct must have had its chance first. It is also what makes dropping the
 * commonmark preset's inline-link transformer safe: `definition`,
 * `linkReference` and `imageReference` have no schema node anywhere else, so
 * the removal and the claim are one change.
 *
 * Image's position is NOT load-bearing either, and it is not a syntax family:
 * it contributes one NodeView over CommonMark's own image node and no parser,
 * schema or serializer at all, so nothing it does can change what a document
 * means or how it is written back.
 *
 * Frontmatter's position is NOT load-bearing, despite reading that way. It
 * contributes only micromark and mdast-util extensions and no tree transformer,
 * so moving it produces byte-identical output. What keeps a later `---` a
 * thematic break is that the micromark construct only fires at line 1, column 1.
 *
 * Families are meant not to overlap in what they claim: frontmatter owns
 * document-leading `---`/`+++` fences, callout owns blockquotes opening with a
 * `[!TYPE]` marker, mermaid owns fences whose info string is exactly `mermaid`,
 * math owns `$`-delimited spans and blocks, and the inline splitters own their
 * own bracket forms inside text nodes only — never inside code, whose payload
 * never appears as text. Where a family's claim and source preservation's do
 * overlap, running last is what settles it: a block whose fence never closes is
 * taken back from whichever family claimed it, because none of them can write
 * an unterminated fence, and that is why every family leaves the source position
 * on the nodes it produces.
